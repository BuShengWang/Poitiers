A brief summary for SSAdNDP is presented, in case you are interested.

A Paper for this method presented shown as below, and the source package file is attached as well, which contains 
manual in case you would like to have a read.

How to do the calculations?

Step1, do a VASP scf  with below INCAR.
------------------------------------
SYSTEM = SnN
PREC = Accurate
ENCUT = 520.00
EDIFF = 1e-6
IBRION = -1
NSW = 0
ISMEAR = 1
SIGMA = 0.05
ISTART = 0
LCHARG = TRUE
LWAVE = TRUE
PSTRESS = 0
KSPACING = 0.2

#NBO for SSAdDNP
LNBO = True
ISYM = 0
#NPAR = 4
------------------------------------

The wave function file (wavefunction.dat) is expected as an output file. Itâ€™s notable here, the regular 
VASP (official one) does not contain this feature yet. We should make a patch and recompile it. 
(https://github.com/Chengcheng-Xiao/Periodic_NBO)

The one is available on THOR (Irene not yet), you may use the attached script to submit this VASP 
calculation on THOR.


Step2, Project the wave function into Natural Bond Orbital. 

I. Prepare a basis set file for you system in Gaussian format. (You may download it from https://www.basissetexchange.org/ or others)

II. Delete Line #6 (element) of CONTCAR. (NBO and SSAdNDP read VASP-4 format file)

III. Update your environment (bashrc) with following lines for Project and SSAdNDP code.
module load intel-compilers-13/13.1.2.183
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/sdev/intel/composer_xe_2013.4.183/composer_xe_2013/mkl/lib/intel64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

IV. Execute the projection:
> /home/bwang/bin/projection basis.inp wavefunction.dat NBO.out


Step3, Run SSAdNDP analysis to search nc-2e bonds.

Prepare the input file SSAdNDP.inp, see attachment as the template.

> /home/bwang/bin/ssadndp.exe SSAdNDP.inp 

The possible nc-2e bonds would be save in output files vis_gs_nc-bonds.out

To visualize the nc-2e bonds.
> /home/bwang/bin/visual.exe vis_gs_nc-bonds.out 

Then the output files *.cube imported to VESTA code, enjoy. Here, you may need have carefully 
read for more detail information on Manual (page 7, 8).

Friendly note:
To do SSAdNDP analysis (search nc-2e bonds) correctly and efficiently, we would better do it with 
help of classical chemical bonding analysis (Lewis structure, VSEPR, Octet rule, Zintl-Klemm concept).


Best,
